How to use the UNSW Data Archive
################################

The UNSW Data Archive is the primary research storage facility provided by UNSW. The Data Archive gives UNSW researchers a free, safe and secure storage service to store and access research data well beyond the life of the project that collected that data.

To help researchers make use of this system the Katana Data Mover has a script that you can use to copy files from Katana into a project on the Data Archive system.

.. note::
    To use this script you must have access to the UNSW Data Archive which requires setting up a `Research Data Management Plan <https://research.unsw.edu.au/research-data-management-unsw>`_.

The best documentation on how to use the `Data Archive`_ is found on their website:

 - using the `web application`_
 
 - using `SFTP`_

 - using the `Command Line`_


To see what versions of the Data Archive script are available log on to :code:`kdm.science.unsw.edu.au` and type

.. code-block:: bash

    module avail unswdataarchive

Use the help command for usage

.. code-block:: bash

    module help unswdataarchive/2020-03-19

.. warning::
    This advice has poor results. The help file is too long for most screen sizes and there's no pagination in modules version < 4. Last line should include a location that the researcher can read directly (using less)

*************
Initial Setup
*************

To use the Data Archive you need to set up a configuration file. Here's how to create the generic config in the directory you are in:

::

    [z1234567@kdm ~]$ module add unswdataarchive/2020-03-19
    [z1234567@kdm ~]$ get-config-file


Before you use the script for the first time you will need to generate a token for uploading data to the archive. To generate a token send an email to the `IT Service Centre <ITServiceCentre@unsw.edu.au>`_ asking for a Data Archive token to be generated. 

Then edit the configuration file :code:`config.cfg` and to change the line that looks like :code:`token=`

If you haven't generated a token you can also upload content using your zID and zPass by adding the following line to the file :code:`config.cfg` and you will be asked for your zPass when you start the upload.

.. code-block:: bash

    user=z1234567

Starting a data transfer

To get data **into** the archive, we use :code:`upload.sh`

.. code-block:: bash

    upload.sh /path/to/your/local/directory /UNSW_RDS/D0000000/your/collection/name


To get data **from** the archive, we use :code:`download.sh`

.. code-block:: bash

    download.sh /UNSW_RDS/D0000000/your/collection/name /path/to/your/local/directory
