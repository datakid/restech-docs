There are a number of GUI based software packages that are offered through a web interface. The requirements are a Katana account and for the user to be either on campus or connected to the `UNSW VPN`_.

These can be accessed from https://ood.restech.unsw.edu.au

After logging in, you can:

- access your :code:`/home/`, :code:`/srv/scratch/` and any project files from the Files menu. While you can upload files through this interface, please don't upload anything larger than about 10MB. 

- See your active jobs in a web based view of the traditional :code:`qstat` command

- start a new interactive app
