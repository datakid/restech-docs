Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

:ref:`storage_faq`
:ref:`katana_compute_faq`

Where is the best place to store my code?
-----------------------------------------

The best place to store source code is to use a version control server.  This means that you will be able to keep every version of your code and revert to an earlier version if you require.

I just got some money from a grant. What can I spend it on?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of different options for using research funding to improve your ability to run computationally intensive programs. The best starting point is to speak to the Research Technology Services team to figure out the different options.

Can I access Katana from outside UNSW?
--------------------------------------

If you have an account then you can connect to Katana from both inside and outside UNSW. Some services - like remote desktops - will not be as responsive as inside the UNSW network.


Expanding Katana
================
Katana has significant potential for further expansion. It offers a simple and cost-effective way for research groups to invest in a powerful computing facility and take advantage of the economies that come with joining a system with existing infrastructure. A sophisticated job scheduler ensures that users always receive a fair share of the compute resources that is at least commensurate with their research groupâ€™s investment in the cluster. For more information please contact us.

Acknowledging Katana
====================

If you use Katana for calculations that result in a publication then you should add the following text to your work.

::

    This research includes computations using the computational cluster Katana supported by Research Technology Services at UNSW Sydney.

If you are using nodes that have been purchased using an external funding source you should also acknowledge the source of those funds.

For information about `acknowledging ARC funding <http://www.arc.gov.au/about_arc/acknowledgementform.htm>`_

Your School or Research Group may also have policies for compute nodes that they have purchased.

Facilities external to UNSW
---------------------------

If you are using facilities at Intersect_ or NCI_ in addition to Katana they may also require some form of acknowledgement.
