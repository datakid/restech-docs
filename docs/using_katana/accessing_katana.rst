Accessing Katana
================

Anyone at UNSW can apply for an entry level account on Katana. This is designed for those groups that are thinking that Katana would suit their research needs or will typically use less than 10,000 CPU hours a quarter. Those at this level still get access to the same level of support including software installation and help getting starting running their jobs. The only difference is the number of compute jobs that can be run at any time and how long they can run for.

Some Faculties, Schools and Research Groups have invested in Katana and have a higher level of access. Users in this situation should speak to their supervisor.
