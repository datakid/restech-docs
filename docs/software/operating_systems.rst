Katana nodes are running either RedHat 7.7 (management plane) or CentOS 7.7 (compute nodes). 

Research software is installed in modules so that they can be loaded or unloaded as necessary. This way we can offer and run multiple versions of each package at the same time.

The sections below provide information about some of the specific software that is installed on Katana.
