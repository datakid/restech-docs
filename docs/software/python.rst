It is common for python scripts to begin with 

::

    #!/usr/bin/python

If you are using a Python module, you will need to change the first line to 

::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

Virtual Environments
++++++++++++++++++++

We encourage researchers to utilise the power of `Python Virtual environments <https://github.com/unsw-edu-au/Restech-HPC/tree/master/hpc-examples/virtualenvs>`__ if they are developing their own software or want to use packages that aren't installed.

Conda and Anaconda
++++++++++++++++++

We get a lot of questions about installing Conda and Anaconda. Unfortunately neither are well set up to be installed in multi-user environments.

You are able to install them into your home directory and we encourage you to do so.
